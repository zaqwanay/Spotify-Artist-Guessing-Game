# Business Requirements for Who's Who

***These requirements are subject to change***

## Requirements Overview

The business would like for you to build a prototype 'game' idea that we had. It's basically a music/artist guessing game. The user will be displayed with 1-3 songs and 2-4 artists pictures/names. The user will be able to play the songs and then they'll have to guess which single artist the song or songs belong to. Don't worry to much about a fancy design. Make it look *good enough* for a demo. We have designers that we can bring in later once you create the prototype.

The 'landing' page should probably be a 'configuration' page which lets them pick a genre, the number of songs per guess, and the number of artists to guess from. Once they select their game settings/configuration, it should then take them to the 'game' page. I'll leave it up to you to decide how many 'guesses' the user gets before they lose. If you have time, try to make it mobile friendly for the demo. Also, as a final touch, save their settings that they select on the configuration page so if they leave the page and come back, they won't have to reselect everything. By default, select 1 song and 2 artists.

We don't have the money to pay for any premium music service, so just use Spotify. I believe they have a free/open API. Just use the server that other guy set up that authenticates with Spotify and gives you the token.
